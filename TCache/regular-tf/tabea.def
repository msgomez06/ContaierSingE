%help
    Hi, and thank you for trying out the singularity container set up for use
    in the dawn lab at Université de Lausanne. Documentation for the container
    is currently not available (apart from this help snippets), but feel free
    to contact Milton (milton.gomez@unil.ch) for help if you're using this :)
    
    There following apps are currently loaded in the container:
    the "spyder" app
    the "notebook-setup"
    the "cluster-notebook" app
    
    To get help for each app, type:
    singularity run-help --app <app_name> <container_name>
    
    e.g., if the singularity container is named "PySing.sif", for help with 
    the spyder app you would type:
    singularity run-help --app spyder PySing.sif
    
    Make sure to mount any directories you need to access (e.g., if you're 
	using the container on a cluster). @ Université de Lausanne, in 2022,
	this is done with:
	export SINGULARITY_BINDPATH="/scratch,/users,/work"


%environment
	#Global variables available to all apps






%appenv notebook-setup
    # environment variables for setting up jupyter notebook
    
%apprun notebook-setup
	bash /opt/tc_nbk_setup.sh
    
%apphelp notebook-setup
    Running this app will set up a jupyter notebook configuration file in your
    profile so you can tunnel to the cluster securely.
    
    
    
    
    

%appenv cluster-notebook
    # environment variables for setting up jupyter notebook
    
%apprun cluster-notebook
	bash /opt/tc_nbrun.sh
    
%apphelp cluster-notebook
    Running this app will start a jupyter notebook that you can securely tunnel
    to!
    
    Once you have the notebook server running on the cluster, open a separate
    terminal and write:
    
    ssh -N -f -L <my_port_#>:<compute_node>:<my_port_#> <username>@<cluster>
    
    e.g., if I had set up my notebook server on the curnagl cluster @ UNIL 
    using, having been assigned the dna024 node and having selected port 8888,
    the command would be:
    ssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:dna024:8888 mgomezd1@curnagl.dcsr.unil.ch

%appenv spyder
	#environment variables for spyder

%apprun spyder
	# Runscript for spyder
    bash /opt/spyder_run.sh
    
    
%apphelp spyder
	Running this app will load Spyder 5.3.2 with the dev_env environment
	that was specified by /opt/dev_env.yml in the conainer. Note that since
	singularity containers are read only, changes to the .yml file will do
	nothing.
